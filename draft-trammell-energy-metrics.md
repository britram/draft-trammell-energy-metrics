--- abstract

This document makes a set of recommendations for defining comparable metrics for 
the energy consumption attributable to Internet services, based on a set
of assumptions about the applicability of these metrics to increasing the
environmental efficiency of these services.

In addition, this document defines the following term:

- Internet service: An application that has some utility for an end user
  {{?END-USERS=RFC8990}} that uses the Internet for some part of its essential
  communication, delivered by some combination of end-user parts (i.e. an
  application or user agent running on an endpoint connected to the Internet),
  server parts (i.e. code supporting the application not running on user agents,
  such as a content delivery network or servers running on behalf of the
  application developer), and network parts (network equipment implementing
  the paths among end-user and server parts, such as terrestrial layer 1-3
  equipment, radio access networks, satellite networks, and so on).
